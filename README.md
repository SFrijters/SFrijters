# Stefan C.J. Frijters, PhD

 * As an ambitious software engineer, I like to learn things and creatively solve challenging software problems in a principled way, preferably in a small team where individual input is valued. I take pride in efficiently building software that is correct, fast, and beautiful. I appreciate opportunities to contribute to open source software and to work adjacent to cutting edge science.
* My main software interests are embedded software, modern typesafe and functional languages, testing, reproducibility, other techniques that help build better software, and high-performance computing.
* I would like to do my programming in Rust, Haskell, [DLang](https://dlang.org), and/or C. I strongly prefer using Linux ([NixOS](https://nixos.org) in particular) or BSD as an operating system.
* _Although the domains of cryptocurrency, adtech, fintech, and the fossil fuel industry are often relatively keen on using the aforementioned technologies, I am currently not interested in working on these kinds of applications._
